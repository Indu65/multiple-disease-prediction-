# Multiple Disease Prediction System

## Project Overview
The **Multiple Disease Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application that predicts possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms. This system helps users understand potential health issues and take timely action.

## Features
- Predicts multiple diseases based on user symptoms.
- User-friendly interface for symptom input.
- Uses machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Easy to extend with more diseases and symptoms.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** â€“ main programming language.
- **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `flask` (or `django` if used for web interface).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, or other classification models.
- **Dataset:** Medical dataset with symptom-disease mappings.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
# multiple-disease-prediction-

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the application:

python app.py  # or main.py depending on your project
